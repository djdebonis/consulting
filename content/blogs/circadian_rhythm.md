My Father always set the Cuisinart to 4:30 a.m. The Cuisinart always ran just a few minutes fast. When the time had come, the machine would start up by dispensing the coffee beans into the grinder. A few seconds would pass, and then, for a moment, the house would be silent. Then the crunch and grind of beans would fill the house, fading into the whir of the blade as the grounds spilled into the filter. My Father’s house was all hardwood cabinets and hardwood floors—the sound echoed wall to wall. As the hot water percolated through the beans, the aroma of roasted nuts, herbs, and cacao would fill the first floor.

My Father drank his coffee black, out of tall and slender white Italian mugs. He always bought the Komodo Dragon blend from Starbucks. When he woke up, he would sit on the couch and read the news while drinking his coffee, waiting for the sun to rise. 

My Father drank dark roast coffee, and he always rose before me. 

When I first left home, I bought Folgers coffee and brewed it in a stovetop percolator, on a camp stove outside of my van. I missed the taste of the Komodo Dragon blend, and drinking it out of tall and slender, white Italian mugs. When I first left home, I never prayed once. I rose with the sun. I ate three eggs fried over-easy in olive oil, and sipped my coffee, wondering where in God’s name I was going. I looked out over the desert and sweat beads formed on my brow.

When I left Zion, my Father surprised me with a Hotel Room in St George. He prepaid for a suite at the Hilton Gardens. I showered and went to the Golden Corral and ate a week’s worth of food in a sitting. I went back to the hotel room and fell asleep for 10 hours, and when I rose I walked down to the lobby, which was filled with the aroma of dark-roast coffee, and the low volume of a news reporter on the television. I drank dark roast coffee out of a nice paper cup, wondering where in God’s name I was going. I returned to the van, to the desert.
