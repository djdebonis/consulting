Been having trouble sleeping lately? Had a hard time getting out of bed? Here’s how tuning into your circadian rhythm could help you to improve your sleep, heighten your mood, and boost your energy.

## What is the Circadian Rhythm?

The circadian rhythm is the body’s natural cycle. The circadian rhythm influences the regulation of sleep, hormone secretion, body temperature, energy, and other behavioral mechanisms.

The word “circadian” derives from Latin: circa, which means “about,” and dies, which means “day;” thus, the circadian rhythm is about a day in length (1).

Our circadian rhythms are mediated by our “biological clock,” which scientists have discovered is primarily in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a bundle of neurons in the hypothalamus (2).

The circadian rhythm is regulated by both internal and external factors:

### Internal Regulation

The internal processes of the circadian rhythm (in the SCN) are thought to be regulated by the clock gene, which regulates the production of proteins. The time it takes for these proteins to be produced and degraded is the base “unit” of time that our internal circadian rhythm is built from. Much like a second-hand on a clock, the expression of these proteins are the “ticks” of our circadian clock (2).

### External Regulation 

The body’s clock is also regulated with external factors called zeitgebers (German: zeit is time, geber is giver) (3). Zeitgebers are external factors that orient the body’s circadian rhythm and essentially ‘set’ the clock (2). The primary zeitgeber is light, however other factors such as food, exercise, and social interactions have also been recognized (4)(5).

##  Why should we care about the circadian rhythm?

Our circadian rhythms are important for regulating many aspects of our daily lives, such as body temperature, energy, and sleep.  

The circadian rhythm has also been found to elicit a noticeable effect on mood; most people with mood disorders demonstrate disruptions in circadian rhythms (6). The monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) are hypothesized to be responsible for mood and anxiety disorders. These neurotransmitters also function on a circadian cycle

However, in modern society it is difficult for us to synchronize our external circadian factors with our innate, internal rhythm. This is because we are pressed to busy schedules that cause us to sleep, exercise, eat, socialize, and work at odd hours. There is also increased exposure to artificial light combined with decreased exposure to natural daylight, which affects our circadian rhythm and thus our sleep/wake cycles and circadian synchronization.

There is evidence to support that desynchronization of external factors (zeitgebers) to internal circadian cycles is potentially harmful to health. Misalignment of these processes could increase the potential for health consequences such as cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, sleep disorders, and even elevated cancer susceptibility (7).

Desynchronization of external factors can also interfere with cognition (specifically reaction time, vigilance, motivation, and memory). Studies on rats and hamsters have demonstrated that circadian disruptions (typically light/dark cycles) impair learning and memory (7).

 It thus becomes apparent that many potential health benefits could be derived from synchronizing our external factors (zeitgebers) with our bodies’ internal rhythms. This post will propose a potential plan to improve circadian synchronization and thus improve downstream health benefits. Some day deeper analyses will be provided that address these specific health benefits, such as mood and sleep.

## How can I fix my circadian rhythm?

A couple years back I had a conversation with professor Ben Greenwood, who leads the Exercise and Behavioral Neuroscience Lab at the University of Colorado, Denver. He expressed that, after waking up at the same—or at least a similar—time every day is one of the most important activities one can do to improve their cicadian rhythm. He then explained that, after waking up at the same time, many neuroscientists and physiologists have adopted the following habits to improve their circadian rhythm and thus their physical and mental health:

1) Exercise (preferably moderate-intense exercise)

2) Eat a large meal (frontload a large chunk of calories for that day, if possible)

3) Expose yourself to natural daylight

According to many people in the neuroscience field, if these habits are completed within the first hour or two of awakening, the habits can help synchronize the circadian clock.

 As we saw above, all of these habits are examples of zeitgebers. By exposing yourself to these zeitgebers at the same time every day, your internal circadian rhythm will adapt to synchronize with these zeitgebers, which may help increase your mood and energy levels. More than anything, though, aligning these zeitgebers can help you fall asleep faster, sleep more efficiently, and obtain higher quality sleep (4).

 And, regardless of the benefits these practices could have on circadian clock synchronization,  including all of these healthy habits in your day will surely help you to feel better. Exercise helps improve mood, reduce anxiety,  and improves cognition & neurogenesis; eating a large, healthy meal offers sustainable energy; exposure to natural daylight, as we know well, doses us  with vitamin D!

 Since this conversation with Dr. Greenwood I have spent a lot of time playing with this thought and experimenting with how different zeitgebers interact with my own sleep/wake cycle. Utilizing the aforementioned recommendation, some research, and anecdotal experience, I have developed a list of things that help to synchronize the circadian rhythm and hence improve overall physical and mental well-being.
 
## 1. Wake up at the same time every day

This is a habit that can be hard to develop, especially considering the bounds of our societal habits and responsibilities. Work, school, family obligations, and social participation are all factors that are sometimes out of our control.

However, I have found that if you wake up consistently within the range of an hour (say, between 5 and 6 a.m.), it can enhance your mood and productivity.

## 2. Drink two glasses of water immediately after waking up

This is something my dad taught me a few years back, and it is something that I try to practice every day. I have no evidence to suggest it has a role in circadian rhythm, but it kick-starts your metabolism and sets your hydration levels off on the right foot.

## 3. Expose yourself to natural daylight as soon as you can.

Light is the primary zeitgeber that sets our circadian clocks. Many cases of insomnia can be traced to lack of exposure to natural daylight during the day and too much exposure to artificial light at night!

## 4. Exercise.

Moderate-intense exercise is always preferred. I like to run a few miles (which—during the summer especially—works swimmingly because then I knock out steps 3 and 4 at the same time). Otherwise I might go to the gym or do a calisthenics workout.

And, even on days when I’m not feeling up to it or I don’t have time, I try to shadowbox for 10 minutes then do some stretching to get my blood flowing.

## 5. Eat a large meal every morning. 

I recommend eating food that burns slow and will last. In my experience, if I eat oatmeal and berries, my blood sugar will spike which will guarantee a crash. I like to eat Paleo and Keto based breakfasts—high in protein and healthy fats—because they help with my physical energy & my cognition.

## 6. Shut the screens and dim the lights in the hour before bed

I’m sure you’ve heard this 100 times, but that’s because it’s true and it works. Too much visual stimulation is a major desynchronizer that will interfere with your ability to fall asleep. I recommend reading by a dim lamp light, listening to an audio book in the dark, or even some light stretching or meditating before turning down to sleep.
